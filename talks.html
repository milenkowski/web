With an intensive public display of the strengthening military relationship between the two countries, our findings provide rare insight into DPRK&#8217;s clandestine operations against Russia.<br/><br/>This presentation begins by exploring the ties between DPRK and Russia during the period of the noted breach. We subsequently delve into our methods for pinpointing and recognizing the data breach at NPO Mashinostroyeniya and its significance in the Russian Defense Industrial Base. We then shed light on the organization's security challenges and highlight the threat activity we attribute to DPRK, amidst a slew of peculiar infections and abused network services. We finish by discussing the complexities and dilemmas we faced during this distinctive intrusion investigation.</span><span class="textstyle13"><br/></span></div>

Sandman has been primarily targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East, Western Europe, and the South Asian subcontinent.<br/><br/>The activities are characterized by strategic lateral movements and minimal engagements, likely to minimize the risk of detection. Sandman has deployed a novel modular backdoor utilizing the LuaJIT platform, a relatively rare occurrence in the threat landscape. We refer to this malware as LuaDream. The implementation of LuaDream indicates a well-executed, maintained, and actively developed project of a considerable scale.<br/><br/>At this time, we don&#8217;t have a consistent sense of attribution. LuaDream does not appear to be related to any known threat actors. While the development style is historically associated with a specific type of advanced threat actor, inconsistencies between the high-end development of the malware and poor segmentation practices lead us towards the possibility of a private contractor or mercenary group similar to Metador.</span></div>

From close-knit groups with strategic interests, such as LightBasin and APT41, to loosely affiliated assemblies, such as Lapsus$, the security of Telcos is under constant threat.<br/><br/>In this talk, we review recent targeted attacks against telecommunication providers. We provide insights into a variety of threat activities whose understanding is relevant for better defending against them - from initial infection vectors, detection evasion techniques at malware implementation- and network-level, to OPSEC awareness levels threat actors exhibit. We peek into the current Telco threat landscape to provide relevant takeaways for defenders and foster further discussions on the topic.</span></div>

We discuss the growing trend of espionage actors using Cloud infrastructure for C2 purposes in an attempt to evade detection. We also delve into operation Tainted Love, an APT activity in the nexus of the Chinese cyberespionage groups Gallium and APT41. Next, we explore the Russian-aligned hacktivist group NoName057(16) targeting NATO's infrastructure and end up with an overview of the Russian Winter Vivern group, which has been conducting espionage campaigns in the US and Europe since at least 2018.</span></div>

Encryption can be a time-consuming process, and ransomware developers know this. That is why they get creative when programming encryption routines &#8211; the goal is to minimize the time spent on encryption and maximize the amount of encrypted file content. In this way, the greatest possible irretrievable damage is done in the shortest possible time.<br/><br/>BlackCat is a new and very high-profile player in the current ransomware scene. The way BlackCat performs encryption is highly customizable and ALPHV uses this as an advertising tool to attract affiliates. BlackCat operators can choose between six encryption modes and two encryption algorithms. Ransomware operators can further configure each encryption mode with mode-specific settings. Each encryption mode and algorithm occupies a specific position on the trade-off scale between encryption speed and completeness. <br/><br/>We reverse-engineered the BlackCat ransomware to provide a first look into the inner workings of the encryption modes that BlackCat implements. Our analysis provides a unique insight into the design decisions that ransomware developers make to achieve an optimal balance between encryption speed and encryption completeness. This work also tests the encryption modes and encryption algorithms that BlackCat implements. We conducted a series of experiments to measure in numbers the trade-off between encryption speed and completeness that the different modes achieve. We examine metrics such as encryption speed, time spent on encryption, and amount of file content encrypted.</span></div>

Metador primarily targets telecommunications, internet service providers, and universities in several countries in the Middle East and Africa. The operators are highly aware of operations security, managing carefully segmented infrastructure per victim, and quickly deploying intricate countermeasures in the presence of security solutions. Metador&#8217;s attack chains are designed to bypass native security solutions while deploying malware platforms directly into memory. <br/><br/>SentinelLabs researchers discovered variants of two long-standing Windows malware platforms, and indications of an additional Linux implant. At this time, there&#8217;s no clear, reliable sense of attribution. Traces point to multiple developers and operators that speak both English and Spanish, alongside varied cultural references including British pop punk lyrics and Argentinian political cartoons. While Metador appears primarily focused on enabling collection operations aligned with state interests, we&#8217;d point to the possibility of a high-end contractor arrangement not tied to a specific country. This release is a call to action for threat intelligence researchers, service providers, and defenders to collaborate on tracking an elusive adversary acting with impunity.</span></div>

Its widespread presence raises concerns related to the content, the security, and the privacy of collected data. This makes telemetry an important target for analysis. <br/><br/>This talk focusses on the telemetry mechanism implemented in Windows 10 &#8211; Windows Telemetry. We first discuss the relevance of Windows Telemetry for analysis, with an emphasis on concerns critical to users of Windows 10 and of telemetry-enabled software in general. We then give an overview of its architecture. This includes the data sources, showing the extent of integration of Windows Telemetry in the operating system itself. In addition, we present on the communication interfaces of Windows Telemetry and characterize the network traffic originating from it. Finally, we discuss how the activity of Windows Telemetry can be reduced or stopped. We present the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches for achieving this as well as relevant operational aspects.</span></div>

When securing an environment, IT security officers are often faced with the question of how accurate deployed IDSes are at detecting attacks. To this end, metrics for assessing the attack detection accuracy of IDSes have been developed. However, these metrics are defined with respect to a fixed set of hardware resources available to the tested IDS. Therefore, IDSes deployed in virtualized environments featuring elasticity (i.e., on-demand allocation or deallocation of virtualized hardware resources during system operation) cannot be evaluated in an accurate manner using existing metrics. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of elasticity on IDS attack detection accuracy. In addition, we propose a novel metric and measurement methodology for accurately quantifying the accuracy of IDSes deployed in virtualized environments featuring elasticity. We demonstrate their practical use through case studies involving commonly used IDSes.</span></div>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the rigorous evaluation of IDSes in virtualized environments, with a focus on IDSes designed to detect attacks leveraging or targeting the hypervisor via its hypercall interface. We present hInjector, a tool for generating IDS evaluation workloads by injecting such attacks during regular operation of a virtualized environment. We demonstrate the application of our approach and show its practical usefulness by evaluating a representative IDS designed to operate in virtualized environments. The virtualized environment of the industry-standard benchmark SPECvirt_sc2013 is used as a testbed, whose drivers generate workloads representative of workloads seen in production environments. This work enables for the first time the injection of attacks in virtualized environments for the purpose of generating representative IDS evaluation workloads.</span></div>

As a result, attackers are exploring vectors to attack hypervisors, against which an attack may be executed via several attack vectors such as device drivers, virtual machine exit events, or hypercalls. Hypercalls enable intrusions in hypervisors through their hypercall interfaces. Despite the importance, there is very limited publicly available information on vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers and attacks triggering them, which significantly hinders advances towards monitoring and securing these interfaces. In this paper, we characterize the hypercall attack surface based on analyzing a set of vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers. We systematize and discuss the errors that caused the considered vulnerabilities, and activities for executing attacks triggering them. We also demonstrate attacks triggering the considered vulnerabilities and analyze their effects. Finally, we suggest an action plan for improving the security of hypercall interfaces.</span></div>
